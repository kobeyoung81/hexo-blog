## How to read research papers:
Compile list of papers (median/blog posts)
Skip around list, list up paper list
mark process of each paper 绘制一个资源表格，标注进度
rough guideline: 5-20 papers basic understanding of an area, 50-100 papers for a very good understaning
## How to read one paper: Take multiple passes
Read title/abstract/figures
Intro + conclusions + Figures, skim rest (skip related work)
Read but skip/skim math
Read the whole thing but skip parts don't make sense
## Try to answer these questions:
What did authors try to accomplish?
What was the key elements of the approach?
What can you use yourself?
What other references do you want to follow?
